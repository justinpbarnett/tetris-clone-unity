# Tetris Clone
Recreation of the classic game, Tetris, using the Unity game engine.

I will be loosely following the [Make A Tetris Style Puzzler In Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/make-a-tetris-style-puzzler-in-unity) course by Wilmer Lin.

The purpose of this project is to increase my skills as a Unity and C# developer.

To play the finished game, I will eventually link an itch.io page here to play in-browser.
